# **App Name**: RIPS Analyzer Pro

## Core Features:

- File Loading: Load multiple RIPS files (text or Excel) simultaneously.
- Data Parsing: Parse the RIPS files to extract relevant data blocks (AF, AM, CT, etc.).
- CT Validation: Validate the information from other RIPS segments (like AF, AM) against the CT file.
- AF Summary: Summarize the financial data from AF files, including total amounts per provider.
- Data Visualization: Display parsed data and validation results in an easy-to-understand table format.
- Excel Export: Allow users to export the summarized AF data into an Excel file for further analysis.
- Error Analysis Tool: Leverage AI to interpret validation errors and suggest potential corrections or areas to investigate in the RIPS files. The AI tool analyzes the context of the errors based on other data and provides ranked suggestions. The AI is only used to identify the correct fix to errors; the user must still accept any suggestions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant purple (#9c27b0), chosen to evoke a sense of sophisticated technology and clinical precision.
- Background color: A dark desaturated purple (#1a141d) which provides a professional and easy-on-the-eyes viewing experience.
- Accent color: A vivid blue (#29b6f6) as a contrast to the purple and dark background.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean and modern user interface. 'Inter' will be used in both headings and body.
- Use clear and recognizable icons to represent actions like loading, validating, processing, and exporting.
- Maintain a clear and organized layout with distinct sections for file input, validation results, and data summaries.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback during loading, validation, and processing steps.
